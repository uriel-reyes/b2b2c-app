# b2b2c-app

The purpose of this app is to illustrate a lightweight use case of `stores` and `channels` through the lens of B2B2C. 

As an industry leader in 'x' industry (concrete, electrical supply, etc.) I may want to offer partnership opportunities to certain distirbutors. As the industry leader, I would allow those distributors to use our commerce platform to sell goods, manage their own prices, inventories, product availability, customers and orders.
